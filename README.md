# port-scan-using-nmap
In this Scan, I have scanned TCP SYN Scan of my local IP address and found open ports in the address.
I have scanned Port 445 which is often targeted by malware and attackers. Finding which machines have it open lets patch, disable, or secure it.I have scanned the port 445 which is  SMB (Server Message Block) file sharing enabled on port 445.
I have also detected the  port 445 vulnerabilities present in my IP Address which is used to identify any potential security risk from the ports.
